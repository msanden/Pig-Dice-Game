## Description
A player rolls a die repeatedly on each turn until they decide to "hold" or they roll a 1:
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and lose their turn,
* If they roll any other number, it is added to their turn total and their turn continues,
* If they choose to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and pass on their turn.
